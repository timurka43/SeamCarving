# SeamCarving
Content-Aware image resizing program that reduces the dimensions of an image by cutting the least important seams.

## Collaborators:
Peter Murphy and Krishna Nayar, classmates in my CSC-301 Analysis of Algorithms class

## Current implementation
Currently the software is implemented so it takes in the InitialImage.png provided in this repository and reduces it from size 507x285 to
size 408x285. It only performs the vertical seam-cutting, thus reducing the width (number of column pixels) of the image

## Further Development
At some point I might implement the extension of this project so that it can take user-provided image, and desired dimensions for both 
width and height and reduce the image both horizontally and vertically.
