# Seam Carving: Content-Aware Image Resizing
Seam carving is a technique for content-aware image resizing that reduces the dimensions of an image by removing the least important seamsâ€”paths of connected pixels with the lowest cumulative energy. This approach allows for intelligent resizing without distorting the most important features of the image.

## Collaborators
* Peter Murphy
* Krishna Nayar

Both collaborators are classmates from the CSC-301 Analysis of Algorithms class, contributing to various aspects of algorithm design and implementation.

## Contributions
### My Contributions
* Designed and implemented the vertical seam-carving algorithm, focusing on reducing the image's width while preserving key visual elements.
* Implemented the dynamic programming approach to efficiently find and remove low-energy seams.
* Identified and corrected design bugs in the program to ensure proper functionality for the final submission.
* Converted the pixel data structure back into the finalized image format after seam removal.

### Collaborators' Contributions
* Peter Murphy: Assisted with algorithm validation and contributed to refining the dynamic programming approach.
* Krishna Nayar: Worked on converting the image into a data structure and calculating each pixel's energy for use in the seam-carving algorithm.

## Acknowledgment
We would like to express our gratitude to Professor William Rebelsky for providing the energy function used in our implementation, which served as a foundational component of our seam-carving algorithm.


## Current Implementation
The current implementation processes the InitialImage.png provided in the repository and reduces its dimensions as follows:

* Original Dimensions: 507x285 (width x height)
* Reduced Dimensions: 408x285 (width x height)

## Features:
* Vertical Seam Cutting: Reduces the width (number of columns) by repeatedly identifying and removing vertical seams with the lowest energy.
* Dynamic Programming: Ensures efficient calculation of the optimal seams for removal.

## Further Development
Future iterations of this project aim to extend functionality in the following ways:

1. Horizontal Seam Cutting: Implement seam carving to reduce the image height by identifying and removing horizontal seams.
2.  User-Defined Inputs:
    * Allow users to provide custom images for resizing.
    * Enable users to specify desired dimensions for both width and height.
3 Enhanced Visualization:
    * Provide visual representation of seams before removal.
    * Animate the resizing process for educational purposes.

4. Performance Optimization: Explore parallel processing or GPU acceleration for handling larger images more efficiently.


By implementing these features, the program will become more versatile and robust, capable of accommodating a broader range of use cases.
